    <p>Notes:

    .Signal Pulses: These are rapid bursts of electromagnetic energy, either in visible light (for close observers) or in narrow infrared bands (for long-range reception). I have found they use morse code for this
    .Flight Patterns: Each drone's movement acts as a second communication layer. For instance:
   
    .Clockwise circles may indicate affirmation or confirmation of a received message.
    .Counterclockwise spirals could signal distress or require backup.
    .Tight spirals tend signify urgency, while wider loops suggest routine transmission.
    .Altitude shifts may encode meta-dataâ€”such as intended recipient class or encryption level.</p>
