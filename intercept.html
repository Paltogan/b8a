    <p>signal: A looser loop: .- / .-. --- ..- --. . .-.-.- / .-- .... .- - / ... .... --- ..- .-.. -.. / .-- . / -.. --- ..--..  Then a clockwise, tighter loop: - .... . / -- .-.-.- --. .-.-.- ..--.. / --- -. / .. - .-.-.- As they said the last bit of morse, they lowered the V.U.T.U.R.E, and a static filled my head</p>
    <p>Signal Pulses: These are rapid bursts of electromagnetic energy, either in visible light (for close observers) or in narrow infrared bands (for long-range reception). I have found they use morse code for this


NOTES:        
Flight Patterns: Each drone's movement acts as a second communication layer. For instance:
    Clockwise circles may indicate affirmation or confirmation of a received message.

    Counterclockwise spirals could signal distress or require backup.

    Tight spirals tend signify urgency, while wider loops suggest routine transmission.

    Altitude shifts may encode meta-dataâ€”such as intended recipient class or encryption level.</p>
