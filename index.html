    <h1>VULTURES</h1>
    <p>    Visual: large-winged aerial units; mimic vultures to blend into environment. No biological components.

    Transmission: multi-channel pulse sequences emitted intermittently. Signals utilize spread-spectrum techniques.

    Encoding: hybrid cryptographic layering. Base signal modulated by temporal displacement and frequency hopping.

    Message payload fragmented into micro-bursts; reassembled via synchronized key at receiver.

    Flight patterns integral: angular velocity and circling radius encode supplementary data bits.

    Overlapping signals serve dual purpose—message multiplexing and obfuscation.

    Signal decoding requires dynamic key derivation tied to environmental variables (e.g., wind speed, magnetic anomalies).

    False positives common without real-time cross-referencing with secondary “vulture” network nodes.

    Operational security: complete signal blackouts scheduled periodically to reset detection baseline.

    System optimized for covert transmission in hostile surveillance zones.
